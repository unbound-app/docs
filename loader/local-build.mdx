<Steps>
  <Step title='Building'>
    The Unbound client bundle comes with an npm script for building it: `bun run build`. You can also use `nodemon` to watch over code changes and automatically build.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Hosting'>
    Next, you must obtain a valid URL that points to the bundle. You can serve Unbound's client bundle with `bun run serve` which will provide you with the link to use in the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title='Configuring'>
		Finally, you must configure the loader key `update.url` to our own, locally hosted version of the bundle. Please see the [loader configuration page](/loader/configuration) for more information.
  </Step>
